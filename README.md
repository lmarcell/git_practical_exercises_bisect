# git_practical_exercises_bisect
This repository is the base for a practical git exercise

This exercise is an advanced level one and it is focusing on practising the usage of command git bisect.

## Exercise:

In this repository you find a very simple python script, called return42.py.
In the beginning this script does what it should, it returns the value 42. But later something goes wrong and it returns some other value. The exercise is to find the commit which introduced the bug, without taking a look on the code at all.
Please use the git bisect command for this purpose. Automate the testing if possible.
